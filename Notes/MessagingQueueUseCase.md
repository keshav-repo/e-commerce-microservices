## Messaging queue use case

Messaging queues can be used in an e-commerce application like Amazon to handle various scenarios that require asynchronous communication and decoupling of components. Here are some scenarios where messaging queues are commonly used:

1. Order Processing: When a customer places an order, the order details can be published to a messaging queue. This allows the order processing system to consume the messages and process orders asynchronously, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.

2. Inventory Management: Changes in inventory levels, such as product stock updates or replenishment notifications, can be published to a messaging queue. Other systems, such as the product catalog or warehouse management, can consume these messages to keep their data in sync.

3. Payment Processing: Payment-related events, such as successful payments, refunds, or chargebacks, can be published to a messaging queue. Other systems that need to be aware of payment events, such as fraud detection or financial reporting, can consume these messages and take appropriate actions.

4. Product Recommendations: As customers browse products, their interactions and preferences can be captured and published to a messaging queue. A recommendation engine can consume these events, analyze user behavior, and generate personalized product recommendations to be displayed to customers.

5. Shipping and Logistics: When an order is ready for shipment, shipping details can be published to a messaging queue. The logistics system can consume these messages and initiate the shipping process, generating labels, tracking numbers, and notifying customers about the shipment status.

6. Customer Notifications: Events like order confirmations, delivery updates, or promotional offers can be published to a messaging queue. A notification service can consume these messages and send emails, push notifications, or SMS messages to customers, keeping them informed about their orders and providing a personalized experience.

7. Order Fulfillment and Processing Pipelines: Messaging queues can be used to build robust processing pipelines for order fulfillment. Each step in the pipeline, such as order validation, payment verification, inventory check, and shipping preparation, can be decoupled and orchestrated through message-based communication.

By leveraging messaging queues in these scenarios, an e-commerce application can achieve asynchronous processing, improve scalability, enhance fault tolerance, enable real-time updates, and facilitate seamless integration between different components and systems.

## Subscriber in Order Processing

In the context of Order Processing in an e-commerce application, subscribers are the components or systems that consume messages or events related to order processing from a messaging queue. These subscribers perform specific tasks or actions based on the events they receive.

Here is a list of potential events and their corresponding subscribers in the Order Processing scenario:

1. Order Placed Event:
   - Subscriber: Order Processing Service
   - Description: The order placed event is triggered when a customer successfully submits an order. The Order Processing Service consumes this event to initiate the order processing flow.

2. Payment Processed Event:
   - Subscriber: Payment Service
   - Description: When a payment is successfully processed for an order, the Payment Service consumes this event to update the payment status and perform any necessary financial operations.

3. Inventory Updated Event:
   - Subscriber: Inventory Management Service
   - Description: This event is triggered when there are changes in the inventory levels of products included in an order. The Inventory Management Service consumes this event to update the product stock levels accordingly.

4. Order Status Updated Event:
   - Subscriber: Customer Notification Service
   - Description: When the status of an order changes (e.g., order shipped, order delivered), the Customer Notification Service consumes this event to send relevant notifications to the customer, keeping them informed about the progress of their order.

5. Order Cancelled Event:
   - Subscriber: Refund Service, Inventory Management Service
   - Description: If an order is cancelled, the Refund Service consumes this event to initiate the refund process and the Inventory Management Service consumes it to update the product stock levels.

6. Shipping Prepared Event:
   - Subscriber: Shipping and Logistics Service
   - Description: When an order is ready for shipping, the Shipping and Logistics Service consumes this event to generate shipping labels, assign tracking numbers, and initiate the shipping process.

These are just a few examples of events and their subscribers in the Order Processing scenario. Depending on the specific requirements and architecture of the e-commerce application, there can be additional events and subscribers involved, such as fraud detection, order validation, invoice generation, etc. The subscribers are responsible for handling the events, performing relevant actions, and ensuring the smooth execution of the order processing flow.

### Topic: Order-topic 
In the context of an e-commerce platform like Amazon, the choice of partition key for the `orders-topic` in the order service depends on the specific requirements and design of the system. Here are a few considerations to help determine the partition key:

1. Order ID: Using the order ID as the partition key can ensure that all messages related to a specific order are stored in the same partition. This allows for easy retrieval and processing of order-related events or updates.

2. Customer ID: If the focus is on customer-centric operations or tracking, using the customer ID as the partition key can group all orders related to a specific customer into the same partition. This enables efficient querying or analysis of orders per customer.

3. Order Date: Partitioning by order date can be useful if there is a need to analyze or process orders based on specific time ranges. Orders within a certain time period can be stored in the same partition, facilitating time-based data retrieval or analysis.

4. Region/Location: If the e-commerce platform operates in multiple regions or locations, partitioning by region or location can help localize order-related data. Orders from the same region can be stored in the same partition, making it easier to perform region-specific operations or reporting.

5. Hybrid Approach: Depending on the requirements, a combination of attributes can be used as a composite partition key. For example, using a combination of customer ID and order date can provide a balance between customer-specific processing and time-based analytics.

It's important to consider the expected workload, data distribution, and access patterns when choosing the partition key. The goal is to distribute the data evenly across partitions to achieve good load balancing and avoid potential hotspots. Additionally, consider the scalability requirements, fault tolerance, and potential impact on order processing or querying efficiency.

Ultimately, the choice of partition key for the `orders-topic` should align with the specific needs of the e-commerce platform and support efficient data processing, querying, and analysis in the order service.

### Suppose there are 1 million order coming in a e-commerce application. for order topic, what is the number of partition we should have ?
Determining the number of partitions for the order topic in an e-commerce application depends on several factors, including the expected workload, throughput requirements, scalability, and fault tolerance considerations. Here are some considerations to help determine the number of partitions:

1. Throughput: Each partition in Apache Kafka can handle a certain rate of incoming messages. The number of partitions affects the overall throughput of the topic. As a general guideline, Kafka can handle thousands of messages per second per partition. If you have a target throughput in mind, you can divide the expected load by the desired throughput to estimate the number of partitions needed.

2. Parallelism: Having multiple partitions allows for parallel processing of messages by consumer applications. If you anticipate high concurrent processing or want to distribute the workload across multiple consumers, having more partitions can provide better parallelism.

3. Scalability: The number of partitions can determine the scalability of the order topic. Kafka allows you to scale by adding more brokers to the cluster, and having more partitions allows for better distribution of data across the brokers. Consider the future growth and scaling requirements of your application when determining the number of partitions.

4. Consumer Load: If you have multiple consumer applications reading from the order topic, having more partitions can help distribute the load among consumers. Each consumer can consume messages from a specific partition, allowing for better load balancing and increased consumer throughput.

5. Retention Period: Consider the retention period for the order topic. If you have a long retention period or you need to retain data for a longer duration, having more partitions can help distribute the storage load across the Kafka cluster.

It's important to strike a balance when determining the number of partitions. Having too few partitions can limit the throughput and scalability, while having too many partitions can add unnecessary overhead and increase management complexity.

As a starting point, you can consider having a number of partitions that aligns with the number of consumer applications or the desired level of parallelism. It's also recommended to monitor the system's performance and make adjustments to the number of partitions as needed based on the actual workload and requirements of your e-commerce application.

#### Suppose for order-topic we have 10 partition, and the key passed for a message is customerid. We have 10k customers. how the partition number is decided in this case ?
In the scenario where you have 10 partitions for the order-topic and the key passed for a message is the customer ID, the partition number is determined using a partitioning algorithm. Kafka uses the partitioner to decide which partition within the topic a specific message should be assigned to based on its key. 

By default, Kafka uses the **DefaultPartitioner**, which uses a hash-based algorithm to determine the partition number. The key is hashed, and the hash value is used to calculate the partition number. The partition number is determined as `hash(key) % numPartitions`, where `numPartitions` is the total number of partitions in the topic.

In your case, with 10 partitions and 10,000 customers, the partition number will be determined based on the hash value of the customer ID. The partitioner algorithm will distribute the messages across the partitions, ensuring that messages with the same customer ID always go to the same partition.

The partitioning ensures that messages for a specific customer ID are consistently processed by the same consumer within a consumer group. This provides benefits such as preserving the order of messages for a specific customer and enabling processing logic that is specific to each customer.

It's important to note that the partitioning algorithm is deterministic, meaning that for the same customer ID, the partition number will always be the same. This ensures that related messages are stored and consumed from the same partition, allowing for efficient processing and consistency.

By having a sufficient number of partitions (in this case, 10), Kafka can effectively distribute the customer-specific messages across multiple partitions, achieving good load balancing and parallelism across consumers.


#### Rough Estimation

1 million order -> 24 hours
1 hour -> 1 million / 24 -> 1000k request / 24 -> 41k 
1 second ->  41k / 60 * 60 -> 0.0115k request ~ 1 k / second
