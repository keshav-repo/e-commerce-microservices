# Different services where we can choose sql and nosql.

## Nosql Possibility usage cases 

In an ecommerce application like Amazon, there are several services where NoSQL databases can be used based on their specific requirements and characteristics. Here are some common services and areas where NoSQL databases can be applied:

1. Product Catalog Service: The product catalog service, which manages product information, attributes, and inventory, can benefit from a NoSQL database. NoSQL databases like MongoDB or Cassandra provide flexibility in storing and querying dynamic product data with varying attributes.

2. User Profile Service: Storing user profiles and user-related data can be efficiently managed using a NoSQL database. User preferences, purchase history, and personalized recommendations can be stored in a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Apache CouchDB.

3. Session Management Service: NoSQL databases can be used to store and manage session data for user authentication and session management. Redis, a popular in-memory NoSQL database, is commonly used for fast and scalable session management.

4. Shopping Cart Service: The shopping cart service can utilize a NoSQL database to store temporary user data, such as cart items, quantities, and product details. NoSQL databases like MongoDB or Apache Cassandra can provide fast and scalable storage for shopping cart data.

5. Recommendation Engine: NoSQL databases can support recommendation engines that analyze user behavior and provide personalized product recommendations. The flexible schema and scalability of NoSQL databases make them suitable for storing and processing large amounts of user data for recommendation purposes.

6. Order Tracking Service: Tracking and managing order status and delivery information can be efficiently handled using a NoSQL database. NoSQL databases with strong consistency guarantees like MongoDB or Google Cloud Firestore can be used to ensure data integrity in order tracking.

7. Logging and Analytics: NoSQL databases like Elasticsearch or Apache HBase can be used to store and analyze logs, metrics, and other operational data for monitoring and analytics purposes.

It's important to consider the specific requirements, scalability, and performance characteristics of each service when choosing the appropriate NoSQL database and data model. Additionally, a combination of NoSQL and relational databases may be used in an ecommerce application to leverage the strengths of each database type for different services and use cases.

## Considering ecommerce application like amazon, what are the services where we can use Sql and sql db type ?
In an ecommerce application like Amazon, there are several services where SQL databases can be used based on their specific requirements and characteristics. Here are some common services and areas where SQL databases can be applied:

2. Order Management Service: SQL databases are commonly used to store and manage order information, including order details, customer information, shipping addresses, and payment details.

3. Inventory Management Service: SQL databases can be used to store inventory data, including product stock levels, SKU information, and warehouse management.

4. Payment Gateway Service: SQL databases are often used to store payment-related data, such as payment transactions, customer billing information, and transaction history.

It's important to consider the specific requirements of each service, including data relationships, transactional needs, scalability requirements, and querying capabilities when choosing SQL databases and their corresponding database types (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.). Additionally, the use of SQL databases can offer the advantages of structured data, strong data consistency, and support for complex querying operations.
