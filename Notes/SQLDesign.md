## How to design discount straategy in sql 

Designing discount strategies in SQL involves defining the database schema and writing SQL queries to calculate and apply discounts based on various criteria. Here's a basic example of how you can design a discount strategy in SQL:

1. Database Schema:
Consider a simplified schema with two tables: `Products` and `Discounts`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    category VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Discounts (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    discount DECIMAL(5, 2),
    category VARCHAR(255),
    min_quantity INT,
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE
);
```

2. Data Population:
Insert some example data into the `Products` and `Discounts` tables.

```sql
INSERT INTO Products (id, name, price, category) VALUES
    (1, 'Product A', 10.0, 'Clothing'),
    (2, 'Product B', 20.0, 'Electronics'),
    (3, 'Product C', 30.0, 'Books');

INSERT INTO Discounts (id, name, discount, category, min_quantity, start_date, end_date) VALUES
    (1, 'Clothing Discount', 0.1, 'Clothing', 2, '2022-01-01', '2022-01-31'),
    (2, 'Electronics Discount', 0.15, 'Electronics', 3, '2022-01-01', '2022-01-31');
```

3. SQL Query for Calculating Discounted Price:
To calculate the discounted price for a product based on the applicable discount strategy, you can use SQL joins and conditions. Here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT
    p.id,
    p.name,
    p.price,
    CASE
        WHEN d.discount IS NOT NULL THEN p.price * (1 - d.discount)
        ELSE p.price
    END AS discounted_price
FROM
    Products p
LEFT JOIN
    Discounts d ON p.category = d.category
WHERE
    p.id = 1
    AND d.min_quantity <= 1
    AND d.start_date <= CURDATE()
    AND d.end_date >= CURDATE();
```

In this query, we join the `Products` and `Discounts` tables on the `category` column and apply the discount if applicable. We also include conditions such as minimum quantity, start date, and end date to ensure that the discount is valid for the given product.

Note that the above example is a simplified representation, and in a real-world scenario, the discount calculation logic and SQL queries may vary based on the specific requirements and complexity of the discount strategies.

By designing the database schema and writing SQL queries to calculate discounts, you can implement and manage various discount strategies in your e-commerce application efficiently.
