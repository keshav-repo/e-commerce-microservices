## Actors
In an e-commerce platform, there are various actors or entities that interact with the system to perform different roles. Here are some common actors in an e-commerce platform:

1. Customers: These are the end-users of the e-commerce platform who browse products, place orders, make payments, and interact with various features and functionalities of the platform.

2. Sellers/Merchants: These are the individuals or businesses who offer products or services for sale on the e-commerce platform. They manage their inventory, set prices, fulfill orders, and handle customer inquiries related to their products.

3. Administrators: These are the individuals responsible for managing and maintaining the e-commerce platform. They oversee the overall operation of the platform, manage user accounts, monitor transactions, handle customer support, and ensure the platform's security and stability.

4. Customer Support: This includes the support team or representatives who assist customers with their inquiries, provide product information, help resolve issues, process returns/refunds, and ensure customer satisfaction.

5. Payment Providers: These are the third-party entities that facilitate payment transactions between customers and sellers. They handle the processing of payments, ensure security, and provide payment options such as credit cards, digital wallets, or bank transfers.
